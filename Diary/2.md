#### 5.2 Toolchain

> Binutils is installed first because the configure runs of both GCC and Glibc perform various feature tests on the assembler and linker to determine which software features to enable or disable.

> The Binutils package contains a linker, an assembler, and other tools for handling object files

> Binutils contains config.guess script file

```bash
ld --verbose | grep search
gcc -print-prog-name=ld
```
For example
```bash
gcc -v dummy.c 
```
will show detailed information about the **preprocessor**, **compilation**, and assembly stages, including gcc's included **search paths** and their **order**.

---

After the run of 
```bash
configure
```
check the contents of the **config.make** file in the **glibc-build** directory for all important details.

> For the second pass of GCC, its sources also need to be modified to tell GCC to use the new dynamic linker. Failure to do so will result in the GCC programs themselves having the name of the dynamic linker from the host system's /lib directory embedded into them, which would defeat the goal of getting away from the host. From this point onwards, the core toolchain is self-contained and self-hosted.

#### 5.4 Binutils

```bash
sudo wget --input-file=http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/binutils/binutils-2.34.tar.xz --continue --directory-prefix=$LFS/sources
```
wget continue to download in loop, idk why.

> the file ./configure of binutils-2.34 contains only 16087 sh rows

<h5 style="text-align:center; color: red;">Bash and sh are two different shells. Basically bash is sh, with more features and better syntax. You should realize /bin/sh on most systems will be a symbolic link and will not invoke sh, but bash, dash, or others</h5>

```bash
sudo find / -type l
sudo find -type l | grep /bin/sh

file usr/bin/sh
sh: symbolic link to bash

hexdump -C sh
00000000  7f 45 4c 46 02 01 01 00  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  |.ELF............|
```
```bash
source ./.bashrc # To load all the env variables written inside
```

**conf.sh should be putted in /lfs/source/binutils-2.34/build**

#### Full command

On the LFS page it is written "/tools" but in chapter 4.2 they used a symlink (ln -sv $LFS/tools /) that I didn't use (I'm gonna regret this later, maybe).
```bash
#!/bin/sh
LFS_TGT=x86_64-lfs-linux-gnu
time { ../configure                     \
        --prefix=/lfs/tools 			\
		--with-sysroot=/lfs				\
		--with-lib-path=/lfs/tools/lib 	\
		--target=$LFS_TGT          		\
		--disable-nls              		\
		--disable-werror				\
 && make -j4 && case $(uname -m) in x86_64) mkdir -v /lfs/tools/lib && ln -sv lib /lfs/tools/lib64 ;; esac && make install; }
```
> 1 SBU = 1m13s with make -j4. With make ~4min

#### General Problems
