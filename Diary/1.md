### Day 1 (I won't program everyday for this journey, it's only symbolical)

**Btw I use Arch**

I'll need this:

> Building a “multi-lib” system requires compiling many applications twice, once for a 32-bit system and once for a 64-bit system. This is not directly supported in LFS because it would interfere with the educational objective of providing the instructions needed for a straightforward base Linux system. Some LFS/BLFS editors maintain a fork of LFS for multilib, which is accessible at http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/~thomas/multilib/index.html. But it is an advanced topic.

[Prerequisites](http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/lfs/view/stable/prologue/prerequisites.html)

I'll **NOT** follow Linux [Standard](http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/lfs/view/stable/prologue/standards.html) Base (LSB) requirements.

> "Several important packages are included that are not strictly required"

[Package choices](http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/lfs/view/stable/prologue/package-choices.html)

### Start

```bash
export LFS=/mnt/lfs
```
>  The shell specified in the /etc/passwd file (for all users) can be configured so that the LFS variable needs to be bash to ensure that the /root/.bash_profile file is incorporated as a part of the login process.
---
Modify your host system's /etc/fstab file to automatically remount LFS partition:
```
E.g.
/dev/sda4  /lfs/ ext4   defaults      1     1
```
---
Make this directory writable and sticky. “Sticky” means that even if multiple users have write permission on a directory, only the owner of a file can delete the file within a sticky directory
```
chmod -v a+wt $LFS/sources
```

#### 3.3 patches required

The next step is to create a /tools symlink on the host system
```bash
ln -sv $LFS/tools /
```
**The created symlink enables the toolchain to be compiled so that it always refers to /tools, meaning that the compiler, assembler, and linker will work both in Chapter 5 (when we are still using some tools from the host) and in the next (when we are “chrooted” to the LFS partition).**

---
```bash
groupadd lfs
useradd -s /usr/bin/bash -g lfs -m -k /dev/null lfs
userdel lfs
passwd lfs
```

Replace the running shell with a new one with a completely empty environment, except for the HOME, TERM, and PS1 variables. 
This ensures that **no unwanted and potentially hazardous environment variables** from the host system leak into the build environment.
```bash
exec env -i HOME=$HOME TERM=$TERM PS1='\u:\w\$ ' /bin/bash
echo $HOME
/home/lfs
echo $TERM
xterm-termite
```
#### 4.5

**For many modern systems with multiple processors (or cores) the compilation time for a package can be reduced by performing a "parallel make" by either setting an environment variable or telling the make program how many processors are available. For instance, a Core2Duo can support two simultaneous processes with:**
```bash
export MAKEFLAGS='-j 2'
```
**or just building with:**
```bash
make -j2
```

When multiple processors are used in this way, the SBU units in the book will vary even more than they normally would. 
In some cases, the make step will simply fail. 
Analyzing the output of the build process will also be more difficult because the lines of different processes will be interleaved. 
If you run into a problem with a build step, revert back to a single processor build to properly analyze the error messages.

A common issue with running the test suites for Binutils and GCC is running out of pseudo terminals (PTYs). This can result in a high number of failing tests. This may happen for several reasons, but the most likely cause is that the host system does not have the devpts file system set up correctly. This issue is discussed in greater detail at http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/lfs/faq.html#no-ptys.

Sometimes package test suites will fail, but for reasons which the developers are aware of and have deemed non-critical. Consult the logs located at http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/lfs/build-logs/9.1/ to verify whether or not these failures are expected. This site is valid for all tests throughout this book.
