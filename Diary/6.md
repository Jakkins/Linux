## Day 6

### [IMPORTANT: 5.36. Changing Ownership ](http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/lfs/view/stable/chapter05/changingowner.html)

> The commands in the remainder of this book must be performed while logged in as user root and no longer as user lfs. **Also, double check that $LFS is set in root's environment**.

If reboot:
### [6.2.3 Preparing Virtual Kernel File Systems](http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/lfs/view/stable/chapter06/kernfs.html)
```bash
mount -v --bind /dev $LFS/dev
mount -vt devpts devpts $LFS/dev/pts -o gid=5,mode=620
mount -vt proc proc $LFS/proc
mount -vt sysfs sysfs $LFS/sys
mount -vt tmpfs tmpfs $LFS/run
```
### 6.3.3 Deploying LFS on Multiple Systems 

### 6.4 Entering the Chroot Environment

```bash
chroot "$LFS" /tools/bin/env -i \
    HOME=/root                  \
    TERM="$TERM"                \
    PS1='(lfs chroot) \u:\w\$ ' \
    PATH=/bin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/usr/sbin:/tools/bin \
    /tools/bin/bash --login +h

Had some exams.
Let's get back to this project.

And start slowly.

Reminder 1
```
In the procedures in Chapter 6, we remove or disable installation of most static libraries. Usually this is done by passing a --disable-static option to configure. In other cases, alternate means are needed. 
In a few cases, especially glibc and gcc, the use of static libraries remains essential to the general package building process. 
```
Reminder 2
```bash
sudo fdisk -l
sudo mount /dev/sda4 /mnt/lfs
env

Important path:
LFS_TGT=x86_64-lfs-linux-gnu
LC_ALL=POSIX
LFS=/mnt/lfs
PATH=/tools/bin:/bin:/usr/bin
```

#### 6.2.1
```bash
mknod -m 600 $LFS/dev/console c 5 1
mknod -m 666 $LFS/dev/null c 1 3

# Some device files under /dev don't correspond to hardware devices.
# - /dev/null not device
# - /dev/console it's a device
# - /dev/sda1, sda2...
# The meaning of a device file is determined by its number, not by its name (the name matters to applications, but not to the kernel). 
# The number is actually two numbers: 
# - the major number indicates which driver is responsible for this device
# - the minor number allows a driver to drive several devices. 
# These numbers appear in the ls -l listing, where you would normally find the file size. 
# E.g. 
# brw-rw---- 1 root disk 8, 0 Jul 12 15:54 /dev/sda
# this device is major 8, minor 0.

IF REBOOT -> read 6.2.4 above
```

[6.3. Package Management ](http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/lfs/view/stable/chapter06/pkgmgt.html)

"The directory tree is based on the Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS)"

Oh man I would like to delete eveything and take the system as clear as possible T.T

```
"Besides the group root with a Group ID (GID) of 0, a group bin with a GID of 1 be present. All other group names and GIDs can be chosen freely by the system administrator since well-written programs do not depend on GID numbers, but rather use the group's name."
```
```
Note the use of the +h directive. 
This tells bash not to use its internal path hashing.
Without this directive, bash would remember the paths to binaries it has executed. 
To ensure the use of the newly compiled binaries as soon as they are installed, the +h directive will be used for the duration of this chapter. 
```

### [6.9. Glibc-2.31, wish me luck](http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/lfs/view/stable/chapter06/glibc.html)

6.9.2.2. Adding time zone data
```bash
You can make this change permanent for yourself by appending the line
	TZ='Europe/Rome'; export TZ
to the file '.profile' in your home directory; then log out and log in again.

ln -sfv /usr/share/zoneinfo/Europe/Rome /etc/localtime
```
6.9.2.3. Configuring the Dynamic Loader 
```
If desired, the dynamic loader can also search a directory and include the contents of files found there. Generally the files in this include directory are one line specifying the desired library path. To add this capability run the following commands:

cat >> /etc/ld.so.conf << "EOF"
# Add an include directory
include /etc/ld.so.conf.d/*.conf

EOF
mkdir -pv /etc/ld.so.conf.d
```

### 6.10. Adjusting the Toolchain

```bash
grep 'SEARCH.*/usr/lib' dummy.log |sed 's|; |\n|g'

SEARCH_DIR("=/tools/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu/lib64")
SEARCH_DIR("/usr/lib")
SEARCH_DIR("/lib")
SEARCH_DIR("=/tools/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu/lib");

# Yes but actually /tools will be useles
```
